# Food-Order-Web-Page

The website project is a simple and visually engaging platform designed to provide users with a seamless browsing experience for exploring a food menu and contacting the service provider. It consists of three primary pages:

Home Page: A welcoming landing page inviting users to explore the website with intuitive navigation links.
Menu Page: Showcases a collection of delicious food items like Pizza, Pasta, and Burger, each presented with a placeholder image and price.
Contact Page: Contains a straightforward form for users to submit their contact details and messages.

Built using HTML and CSS, the website aims to be responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes. With its user-friendly interface, this project serves as a foundation for future enhancements, including dynamic content and improved interactivity using JavaScript.
